Installed and configured Sequelize ORM with PostgreSQL.
Generated User and Todo models, created migrations, and applied database relationships using a foreign key.
Implemented seed scripts to populate the database with sample users and todos.
Encountered an issue with foreign key constraints because seeded todos referenced non-existing user IDs,
which was fixed by retrieving user IDs dynamically from the database.
